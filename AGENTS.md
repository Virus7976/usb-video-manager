This file is the equivalent of an `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` convention file. The
human-facing release notes live in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md); deep architecture
notes can also go in the repo **Wiki**.

## 1. What the app is

An offline Windows (Electron) desktop app for videographers. Pipeline:
**import (SD/USB/phone) → rename → copy+verify → compress → analyze with LOCAL AI → organize into a Projects tree → embed XMP metadata → clear card.**
All "AI" is local: Ollama vision models over HTTP + bundled face-api.js. No cloud, ever.

## 2. Architecture

- **`main.js`** — Electron main process. All privileged work: `ipcMain.handle(...)` handlers,
  ffmpeg/ffprobe spawning (thumbnails, contact sheets, **compression**), ExifTool
  (`exiftool-vendored`) XMP embed, Ollama HTTP calls, MTP/phone via `Shell.Application`
  COM driven by PowerShell `-EncodedCommand`, copy + sampled-SHA-256 verify, NAS mirror,
  finalize/organize. Config load/save lives here.
- **`preload.js`** — `contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('api', {...})`. The ONLY surface the
  renderer may call. Every new IPC needs a one-line bridge here.
- **`src/renderer.js`** — ~9k lines, essentially all UI logic. Rename grid, AI flows,
  destination map, faces, the task bubble/theater, settings, menus.
- **`src/index.html`** — app shell (Fluent titlebar, menu bar, step flow, static modals).
- **`src/styles.css`** — native dark Fluent styling.
- **`src/face-models/`** + **`src/face-api.min.js`** — bundled local face recognition (WebGL).
- **`config.json`** — bundled machine-independent DEFAULTS only. Real user settings live in
  `%APPDATA%\USB SD Auto-Action\config.json` (never committed).

**Golden rule:** renderer ↔ main only through `window.api`. A typical feature =
`ipcMain.handle('x', …)` (main) + `x: (p) => ipcRenderer.invoke('x', p)` (preload) + UI (renderer/html/css).

## 3. Build / release / verify loop

```
node --check src/renderer.js        # and main.js / preload.js if touched — ALWAYS before build
npm run dist                        # electron-builder → dist\USB SD Auto-Action Setup x.y.z.exe
# silent install:  run the Setup .exe with /S
# verify the build actually contains your change by substring-checking the asar:
#   %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\USB SD Auto-Action\resources\app.asar
```

- Releases are published to the Gitea **Releases** tab with the `.exe` attached. `dist/` is gitignored.
- **Gotcha:** `electron-builder`'s `winCodeSign` extraction can fail with a symlink permission
  error on some Windows setups. Workaround: enable Developer Mode / run the build elevated once,
  or pre-extract the winCodeSign cache. The iconed build needs this resolved.

## 4. Conventions (do not break these)

- **Native dark Fluent look.** Every new UI must match the existing dark Fluent style
  (CSS variables in `styles.css`). Verifying the look is part of "done".
- **Offline AI only.** Frames go to local Ollama and nowhere else. Never add a cloud call.
- **Faces are SUGGESTIONS, not auto-tags.** Recognised faces are saved to a person's profile
  as *unconfirmed* and surfaced for the user to confirm (or the explicit 🤖 Auto-faces toggle).
  Never silently mark a clip with a person without the user's confirm step.
- **Generic / no personal data.** The shipped app has NO baked-in personal projects, client
  names, or drive paths. Defaults derive from the OS Videos folder at runtime. Keep it that way.
- **Crash-safety.** Rename/analyze work autosaves (drafts, `finalMeta`, obs cache). Don't
  introduce a flow that loses work on a mid-run crash.
- **Verify before destroy.** Never delete originals before copies are checksum-verified.

## 5. Key subsystems (where to look)

- **Task bubble → popup → theater** (`renderTaskBar`, `openTaskPop`, the `#taskTheater`
  "theater" with the live thumbnail conveyor + activity feed): the single global progress UI.
  Tasks: `setTask(id,label,cur,total,phase,detail)` / `clearTask(id)`; ETA via `etaText`.
  Cancellable ids handled by `cancelTaskById`/`isCancellable` (`ai`, `faces`, `compress`).
- **The mega Analyze** (`finAnalyzeSelected` on Organize; `aiAnalyzeSelected` on the Rename
  grid): PHASE 1 faces (scan → verify via awaited `showFaceReviewGrid`, or auto-tag) → PHASE 2
  name every clip with people woven in. Passes `draft:{subject,description,location}` so it
  IMPROVES existing names. Works on photos.
- **⚡ Quick mode** (`uiPrefs.quickAnalyze`): one single-pass vision call per SUBJECT, copied
  to same-subject siblings; faces also sampled per subject (whole group's keys attached).
  The `quick` flag forces single-pass in `ai:suggest` (skips the 2 extra reasoning passes).
- **🎬 Sort with me** (`openSortChat` inside `showDestinationMap`): guided one-subject-at-a-time
  chat — autoplaying clip + "where does this go?" (folder chips + typed autocomplete) → files the
  group AND saves a filing rule (`routesCache`/`saveRoutes`) so future footage auto-routes.
- **Destination map** (`showDestinationMap`): the live Projects-tree placement, rules
  (`routesCache`), day-folder scheme discovery (`projectBase`/`stripDayLeaf`/`dayFolderMap`),
  the "Suggest with AI" wizard (`openSuggestWizard`).
- **Compression** (`compress:run`/`compress:list`/`compress:defaults` in main): ffmpeg presets
  (balanced H.264 1080p / smaller H.265 / hq); `config.compressMode` = `'external'` (Tdarr
  watch-folder, default) | `'app'` (local ffmpeg). Live progress via `-progress pipe:1`.
- **Photos** ("Path A" done): `finalize:scan` accepts `{dir,includePhotos}`; `faces:frames`
  short-circuits for images (returns the image as the single frame so face detection runs on
  stills); the rest of the chain (poster/contact-sheet/ExifTool XMP into JPG) already handled
  images. "Path B" (photos in the Step-1 rename grid) is NOT done yet.
- **Metadata embed** (`finalize:run`, `buildEmbedTags`): rich XMP/IPTC via ExifTool incl.
  `lr:HierarchicalSubject` (digiKam/Lightroom), `iptcExt:PersonInImage`, Resolve CSV.

## 6. Known limitations / traps

- **Vision models hallucinate.** qwen2.5vl etc. sometimes invents a subject that wasn't shot.
  That bad subject then drives placement. Mitigations: 🎬 Sort with me (human-in-the-loop),
  manual rename, improving the perceive prompt. Don't trust auto-placement blindly.
- **ffmpeg/ffprobe must be on PATH** (or set in Settings) or thumbnails/compression fail.
- **A stale `src/` vs root `renderer.js`:** the ACTIVE renderer is `src/renderer.js` (loaded by
  `src/index.html` and bundled via `build.files`). Don't edit a root-level `renderer.js`.
- **Analyze speed:** full multi-pass per clip is slow (hours for hundreds of clips). ⚡ Quick is
  the answer; keep it the default.

## 7. How to add a screenshot to the README

The app window grabs cleanly with PowerShell (no extra tools) — see `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
Drop PNGs in `docs/screenshots/` and reference them. Avoid screens that expose real client
folder names in a public repo.
